# Configuration

Open VS Code Settings (`Ctrl+,` / `Cmd+,`) and search for "AI Tools Organizer".

## Repositories

**Setting**: `AIToolsOrganizer.skillRepositories`

An array of repositories to browse in the Marketplace. Supports both **GitHub** and **Azure DevOps** repositories. Each entry has `owner`, `repo`, and `branch` fields. Azure DevOps entries also require a `project` field.

| Field | GitHub | Azure DevOps |
|---|---|---|
| `owner` | GitHub user or org | ADO organization name |
| `repo` | Repository name | Git repository name |
| `branch` | Branch name | Branch name |
| `project` | _(not used)_ | **Required** — ADO project name |

You can edit these directly in the Settings UI or add repositories using the **+** button in the Marketplace toolbar.

## Download locations

**Setting**: `AIToolsOrganizer.installLocations`

An object with a download path for each content area. Defaults to `~/.copilot/{area}` for each area. Hooks - Kiro is fixed to `.kiro/hooks`.

You can also change the download location from each view's toolbar using the folder icon button. Selecting "Custom..." opens the Settings UI.

### How locations are scanned

Each area view checks its own `chat.*` setting for scan locations. These settings normally contain a map of paths to enabled/disabled values — paths set to `false` are skipped, and any other value is treated as enabled and scanned. For backward compatibility, legacy array values are also accepted and treated as an enabled list. If the setting isn't configured or has no enabled paths, a default list is generated from template prefixes.

| Area | Setting checked |
|---|---|
| Agents | `chat.agentFilesLocations` |
| Hooks - GitHub | `chat.hookFilesLocations` |
| Hooks - Kiro | Fixed to `.kiro/hooks` |
| Instructions | `chat.instructionsFilesLocations` |
| Plugins | `chat.pluginLocations` |
| Prompts / Commands | `chat.promptFilesLocations` |
| Skills | `chat.agentSkillsLocations` |

**Example**: If `chat.agentFilesLocations` is set to `{ "~/.copilot/agents": true, ".github/agents": false }`, only `~/.copilot/agents` will be scanned. The `.github/agents` location is disabled.

When the setting isn't configured, these default locations are scanned:

| Scope | Locations |
|---|---|
| Workspace | `.agents/{area}`, `.claude/{area}`, `.github/{area}`, `.kiro/{area}` |
| Home | `~/.agents/{area}`, `~/.claude/{area}`, `~/.copilot/{area}`, `~/.kiro/{area}` |

The configured download location from `AIToolsOrganizer.installLocations` is also always included in the scan.

## GitHub token

**Setting**: `AIToolsOrganizer.githubToken`

Optional. Provides higher GitHub API rate limits when browsing many repositories. Create a token at [GitHub Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with `public_repo` scope.

## Azure DevOps token

**Setting**: `AIToolsOrganizer.azureDevOpsPat`

Required when using private Azure DevOps repositories or organization-level projects (unless you provide a token another way). Create a Personal Access Token in your Azure DevOps organization with **Code (read)** permission. Leave blank for public projects that allow anonymous access.

**Environment variable**: `AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT` — if the setting is empty, the extension uses this variable. Useful for terminals/CI or when you prefer not to store the PAT in VS Code settings.

## Cache timeout

**Setting**: `AIToolsOrganizer.cacheTimeout`

How long (in seconds) to cache marketplace data. Default: 3600 (1 hour). Click Refresh in the Marketplace toolbar to bypass the cache.
